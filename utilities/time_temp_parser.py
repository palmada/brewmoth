'''
This module contains functions to parse temperature set points in JSON files and to define
temperature profiles that vary over time. 

The below JSON shows an example of how to structure a temperature set point that varies over time.

The example should result in the following profile:
1 - The temperature will be held at 20째C for a day
2 - The temperature will then ramp up from 20째C to 25째C over two days
3 - Afterwards, the temperature will crash down to 12째C as fast as the system can

 
Notes:
 - All of the functions in this module are unit agnostic; Celsius is used only as an example.
 - To specify a ramp, simply include two consecutive set points, and on the second set point include
  'Type': 'Ramp'
 - If the temperature target of the first time point on a ramp is different from whatever was set previously,
   this will result in a temperature step. If this is not your desired outcome, make sure the first time point 
   on the ramp matches whatever was set previously. To see what we mean by this, just look at the first
   two set points on the example JSON. 
 - For crashing/stepping (changing temperature as fast as the system can go), you do not need to set a type.
 - The order of the time point list doesn't actually matter as they will be sorted correctly by the parser.
